# Milligan's Island
## Overview
This is a portfolio project created for computer science coursework at Oregon State Univeristy.
This command line program is a simple text-based adventure game. In addition to concepts like inheritance, pointers, and STL containers, this game also implements a base class with derived classes that also contain data structure elements that allow the classes themselves to behave like linked lists. Specifically, the player's character is able to inhabit a Space, and move between inherited Space objects with different attributes and methods. 
The goal of this text-based adventure game is to solve a puzzle in the form of several small puzzles. Each puzzle will allow the player to access different items in the various spaces on an island to repair a boat and escape within a certain number of moves.
